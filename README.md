### Background


During the Spring of 2019, I worked on an empirical paper that explored the determinants of vehicle ownership in the NY 
Metro Area. I built a model using the 2010/2011 Regional Household Survey (Cross Sectional Dataset)
to quantify the factors that led households to choose to own {0, 1, 2, 3+} vehicles.
