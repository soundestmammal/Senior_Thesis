# Background

In the Spring of 2019 while a student at Farmingdale State College I have been conducting
empirical research in the Department of Economics within the School of Business.

I am a senior, and this is my third empirical paper in as many semesters. 

As a Junior, my first paper was building a hedonic pricing model to analyze commercial real estate prices in Western Brooklyn, NY and determine the relationship between sale price and distance to subway stations.

Fall Semester of my Senior Year I worked on building a transportation demand model using Logistic Regression and Neural Networks. The specific area of demand modeling was the mode choice for commuters in the Long Island Area to their place of 
employment.

In the Spring of 2019, I am working on an empirical paper that is exploring the determinants of vehicle ownership in the NY 
Metro Area. I am building a model that is using the 2010/2011 Regional Household Survey (Cross Sectional Dataset)
to estimate the factors that lead to households choosing to own {0, 1, 2, 3+} vehicles. I have recently learned about the beauty of Jupyter notebooks and the ability of displaying all of my work of the paper here on Github. I will continue to revisit this in the future.

This semester I have really learned about how important Data Exploration is for data analysis. It is tempting to rush into data modeling and get results but being able to understand your data at a deeper level is valuable. It allows for the construction of a more robust model.
